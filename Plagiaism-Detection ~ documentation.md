- **Layered Architecture:** The diagram illustrates a layered architecture for a Plagiarism Detection System, clearly separating responsibilities into the User Interface, Application, Service, Data, and External Services layers. This separation promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

- **User Interface Layer:** This layer consists of a web browser interfacing with HTML templates that incorporate Bootstrap components for responsive UI. It serves as the primary point of interaction between users and the system.

- **Application Layer:** Built using Flask, this layer manages the core application logic. The `Main App` initializes the application, and `Route Handlers` manage routing and control the flow of data between the front end and backend services.

- **Service Layer:** This is the core logic layer, responsible for various functionalities such as:

  - **Text Processing:** Cleans and prepares the input for further analysis.
  - **Web Search Service:** Queries external search APIs to retrieve potentially plagiarized content.
  - **Similarity Engine:** Compares user content with retrieved data to detect similarities.
  - **Report Generator:** Compiles findings into detailed plagiarism reports.
  - **File Comparison (KMP):** Utilizes the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for efficient file content comparison.

- **Data Layer:** Manages local data storage, including:

  - **File Storage:** Stores user-submitted files.
  - **Temporary Text Storage:** Holds intermediate processed text data used during comparisons.

- **External Integration:** The system connects with external APIs such as Google and Bing Search to fetch real-world web content. This integration enhances the engine's ability to detect copied material from online sources.

- **Feedback Flow:** The diagram depicts inter-service communication flows, especially between the Similarity Engine, Report Generator, and Web Content sources, ensuring accurate and comprehensive plagiarism evaluation.
